# JISHO ME!

This is a WIP Chrome extension that pulls information from Jisho.org based on highlighted text.

### To use:
This is in no way really any use, but if you want to give it a go, pull the repo open `chrome://extensions` and then `Load unpacked extension...`. From here, you can open the background page, where logging and Jisho results will appear in the console.
